How to use this asset:

The asset is ready to use out of the box just one of the premade material to object that is meant to be a hologram or create new material and change its parameters
to achieve the effect you want!

In Texture folder you can find some textures used to achieve different scan lines and flickering patterns, as you can see these textures are super simple
and new texture can be created even in Paint, you can easily create new textures and apply them to your hologram material. 

F.e. black lines in flickering texture mean moment where the object is partly invisible/flickering you can f.e. use there gray color to achieve smoother flickering 
just like I did in flickerTextureGradient.png
